    <p style="max-width:800px; margin:auto; line-height:1.8; opacity:0.9;">
        Stark’s work sits at the intersection of quantum computation, neural systems, 
        and autonomous intelligence security. His research explores how quantum technologies 
        and advanced AI architectures can be jointly leveraged to build high-assurance, 
        adaptive, and resilient computational systems. He has previously developed 
        quantum-hybrid cryptographic frameworks designed to secure AI-driven and autonomous 
        infrastructures against emergent threat models.

        Alongside his technical work, Stark maintains a strong interest in brain–machine 
        interfaces, the dynamics of cognition under stress, and the broader implications 
        of autonomy on societal governance. Outside the lab, he is an avid guitarist, writer, 
        and martial artist — pursuits that continually shape his creative reasoning and 
        scientific intuition.
